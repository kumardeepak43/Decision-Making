Find Grades

<!--Your school has the following grading system based upon the marks(M) obtained by a student:
If M≤10, the grade will be E.
// If 11 ≥M ≤20, the grade will be D. 
 // If 21≥M≤30, the grade will be C. 
  If 31≥M≤40, the grade will be B. 
  If 41≥M≤50, the grade will be A. 
   Your friend will enter his marks out of 50, and your task is to print his grades using a switch statement.-->

   const findGrades = (a) => {
    if ((a>=41)&&(a<=50)){
      return "A";
    } else if ((a>31)&&(a<=40)){
      return "B";
    } else if ((a>21)&&(a<=30)){
      return "C"
    } else if ((a>11)&&(a<=20)){
        return "D"
    } else if(a<=10){
      return "E"
    }else
   return 
   "Enter number between 1-50"
};
